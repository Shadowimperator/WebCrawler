# WebCrawler
Univerisity project regarding a Web crawler

Project done using IntelliJ with Maven.

There's is only one build, so press the build button on your IDE to build the project

There are 2 run configurations. Due to refactoring, they are technically not correct, but they both work, so do not modify.
The first is the "crawlerMain" run configuration, which runs the main code with everything in it (input and output).
The second is the "WebCrawlerTests" run configuration, which is essentially the configuration you choose to run the tests.

The project is contained within the .ZIP file. 

Within it, the "report.md" file contains the web crawler report results.
